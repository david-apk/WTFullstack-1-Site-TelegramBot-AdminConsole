Text Description:<br>
My first try to implement the FullStack Web service.<br>
FrontEnd is based on html / css / js template from open sources:<br>
https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page254/minimalista<br>
I restructured this into a landing page and replaced almost all of the content with a go-template.<br>
A database based on json packages in the data folder.<br>
Inside data / config.json, the starting parameters of the web service are set.<br>
The service is managed through the Telegram Bot.<br>
